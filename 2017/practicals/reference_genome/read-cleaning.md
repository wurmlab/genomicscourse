## Short read cleaning

Sequencers aren't perfect. All kinds of things [can](http://genomecuration.github.io/genometrain/a-experimental-design/curated-collection/Presentations/Sequencing%20Troubleshooting.pptx) and do [go wrong](http://sequencing.qcfail.com/). "Crap in – crap out" means it's probably worth spending some time cleaning the raw data before performing real analysis.

### Initial inspection

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) ([documentation](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/)) can help you understand sequence quality and composition, and thus can inform read cleaning strategy.

Link the raw sequence files (`~/hpc/2017-09-BIO721_genome_bioinformatics_input/reference_assembly/reads.pe*.fastq.gz`) to a relevant input directory (e.g., `~/hpc/2017-09-29-reference_genome/input/01-read_cleaning/`).

Now move to a relevant results directory (e.g., `~/hpc/2017-09-29-reference_genome/results/01-read_cleaning/). 

Here, run FastQC on the `reads.pe2` file. The `--outdir` option will help you clearly separate input and output files (and remember to log the commands you used in the `WHATIDID.txt` file).

Your [resulting directory structure](http://github.com/wurmlab/templates/blob/master/project_structures.md "Typical multi-day project structure"), should look like this:

```bash
tree -h
.
├── [4.0K]  input
│   └── [4.0K]  01-read_cleaning
│       ├── [  53]  reads.pe1.fastq.gz
│       ├── [  53]  reads.pe2.fastq.gz
│       └── [  44]  WHATIDID.txt
└── [4.0K]  results
    └── [4.0K]  01-read_cleaning
        ├── [  28]  input -> ../../input/01-read_cleaning/
        ├── [336K]  reads.pe2_fastqc.html
        ├── [405K]  reads.pe2_fastqc.zip
        └── [ 126]  WHATIDID.txt
```

What does the FastQC report tell you? ([the documentation clarifies what each plot means](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/)). For comparison, have a look at some plots from other sequencing libraries: e.g, [[1]](img-qc/per_base_quality.png), [[2]](img-qc/qc_factq_tile_sequence_quality.png), [[3]](img-qc/per_base_sequence_content.png).

Decide whether and how much to trim from the beginning and end of our sequences. What else might you want to do?

Below, we will perform three cleaning steps:
  * Trimming the ends of sequence reads using seqtk.  
  * K-mer filtering using khmer.
  * Removing sequences that are of low quality or too short using seqtk.

Other tools including [fastx_toolkit](http://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit), [kmc2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1507) and [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic) can also be useful.

### Trimming

[seqtk](http://github.com/lh3/seqtk) ([documentation](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/vivid/man1/seqtk.1.html)) is a fast and lightweight tool for processing FASTA and FASTQ sequences.

Based on the results from FastQC, replace `REPLACE` and `REPLACE` below to appropriately trim from the beginning (`-b`) and end (`-e`)  of the sequences.

```bash
seqtk trimfq -b REPLACE -e REPLACE input/reads.pe2.fastq.gz > tmp/reads.pe2.trimmed.fq
```

This will only take a few seconds (make sure you replaced `REPLACE`).

Let's similarly inspect the paired set of reads, `reads.pe1`, and appropriately trim them.
```bash
seqtk trimfq -b REPLACE -e REPLACE input/reads.pe1.fastq.gz > tmp/reads.pe1.trimmed.fq
```


### K-mer filtering, removal of low quality and short sequences

Say you have sequenced your sample at 45x genome coverage. The real coverage distribution will be influenced by factors including DNA quality, library preparation type and local GC content, but you might expect most of the genome to be covered between 20 and 70x. In practice, the distribution can be very strange. One way of rapidly examining the coverage distribution before you have a reference genome is to chop your raw sequence reads into short "k-mers" of 31 nucleotides, and count how often you get each possible k-mer. Surprisingly,

 * many sequences are extremely rare (e.g., once). These are likely to be errors that appeared during library preparation or sequencing, or could be rare somatic mutations). Such sequences can confuse assembly software; eliminating them can decrease subsequent memory & CPU requirements.
 * Other sequences may exist at 10,000x coverage. These could be pathogens or repetitive elements. Often, there is no benefit to retaining all copies of such sequences because the assembly software will be confused by them; while retaining a small proportion could of such reads could  significantly reduce CPU, memory and space requirements.


 An example plot of a k-mer frequencies from a haploid sample sequenced at ~45x coverage:

![kmer distribution graph from UCSC](img-qc/quake_kmer_distribution.jpg)


It is possible to count and filter "k-mers" using [khmer](http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer) ([documentation](http://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/user/index.html); the [kmc2](http://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) tool is faster and thus can be more appropriate for large datasets).

Below, we use khmer to remove extremely frequent k-mers (more than 100x), remove extremely rare k-mers, and we use seqtk to truncate sequences containing unresolved "N"s and nucleotides of particularly low quality. After all this truncation and removal, seqtk remove reads that have become too short, or no longer have a paired read. Understanding the exact commands – which are a bit convoluted – is unnecessary. It is important to understand the concept of k-mer filtering.

```bash
# 1. Interleave Fastqs (khmer needs both paired end files merged into one file)
seqtk mergepe tmp/reads.pe1.trimmed.fq tmp/reads.pe2.trimmed.fq > tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.fq

# 2. Remove coverage above 100x, save kmer.counts table
khmer normalize-by-median.py -p --ksize 20 -C 100 -M 1e9 -s tmp/kmer.counts \
                -o tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.fq tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.fq
# 3. Filter low abundance kmers
khmer filter-abund.py -V tmp/kmer.counts \
                      -o tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.fq \
                      tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.fq
# 4. Remove low quality bases, short sequences, and non-paired reads
seqtk seq -q 10 -N -L 80 tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.fq | \
                 seqtk dropse > tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.noshort.fq

# 5. De-interleave filtered reads
khmer split-paired-reads.py tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.noshort.fq -d tmp/

# 6. Rename output reads to something more human-friendly
ln -s tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.noshort.fq.1 reads.pe1.clean.fq
ln -s tmp/reads.pe12.trimmed.max100.norare.noshort.fq.2 reads.pe2.clean.fq

```

### Inspecting quality of cleaned reads

Which percentage of reads have we removed overall? (hint: `wc -l` can count lines in a non-gzipped file). Is there a general rule about how much we should be removing?
Run `fastqc` again, this time on `reads.pe2.clean.fq`. Which statistics have changed? Does the "per tile" sequence quality indicate to you that we should perhaps do more cleaning?
