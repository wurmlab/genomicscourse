# Part 3: Gene prediction

You need to have gone through [Part 2: Genome assembly](pt-2-assembly.html)
before starting this practical.

Many tools exist for gene prediction, some based on *ab initio* statistical
models of what a protein-coding gene should look like, others that use
similarity with protein-coding genes from other species, and others (such as
[Augustus](http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/) and
[SNAP](https://github.com/KorfLab/SNAP)), which use both.  

There is no perfect tool or approach, thus we typically run many gene-finding
tools and call a consensus between the different predicted gene models. 
[MAKER](http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html), 
[BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) and 
[JAMg](https://github.com/genomecuration/JAMg) can do this for us.  
In this practical, we will use `MAKER`.

# 1. Running Maker

Following the same procedure described in Section 1.2 of
[Part 1: Read cleaning](pt-1-read-cleaning.html), create a new main directory
for today's practical (e.g., `2024-09-26-gene_prediction`) and the `input`,
`tmp`, and `results` subdirectories, and the file `WHATIDID.txt` to log your
commands.
Link the output (assembly) from Part 2 practical into `input` subdirectory:

```bash
cd ~/2024-09-26-gene_prediction/input
ln -s ~/2024-09-25-assembly/results/scaffolds.fasta .
cd ..
```

Pull out the longest few scaffolds from `scaffolds.fasta` into a new file:

```bash
seqtk seq -L 10000 input/scaffolds.fasta > tmp/min10000.fa
```

Gene prediction can be difficult if the assembly is low quality and does not
include long scaffolds (remember, trash in = trash out). 
For instance, in the case of short scaffolds, if a gene
is 2,000 bp long and includes introns, it may be very hard to find many entire
genes. 

> **_Note_:**  
> If you have difficulty in predicting the genes or you suspect that your
> assembly may be affected by the aforementioned issues, you can use already
> assembled scaffolds.
> ```bash
> # Link this scaffolds file into your input directory
> ln -s /shared/data/backup_assembly/scaffolds.fasta .
> ```

In this practical, we will show how to run MAKER in a simple scenario. For a
better understanding of how this tool works, and how it can be applied in real-case scenarios, 
we *strongly* encourage to read the paper and documentation. Also, checking
which settings were used in recent publications can be very helpful for reproducing (or critiquing) analyses. 

Change to your `tmp` directory and run `maker`:

```bash
cd tmp
maker -OPTS
```
This will generate an empty `maker_opts.ctl` configuration file (ignore the
warnings). Edit that file using a text editor such as `nano` or `emacs` and
specify:

  * genome: `min10000.fa`
  * deactivate RepeatMasker by changing `model_org` line to `model_org=` 
    (i.e., nothing afer `=`)
  * deactivate RepeatRunner by changing `repeat_protein` line to 
    `repeat_protein=` (i.e., nothing after `=`)
  * Augustus_species:`honeybee1` (remember to add 1 at the end; this provides
    hints to Augustus about the gene structure based on what we know about gene composition from the honeybee.

We deactivated RepeatMakser and RepeatRunner due to computational limitations
as well as the lack of a suitable library of repetitive elements for this
species. For a real project, we *would* include RepeatMasker, likely after 
creating a new repeat library for our species.  
For a real project, we would also include gene expression data (RNAseq improves
gene prediction performance *tremendously*), protein sequences from related
species, and iteratively train gene prediction algorithms (e.g., Augustus and
SNAP) for our data.

Finally, run MAKER using the edited configuration. This may take a few 
minutes, depending on how much data you gave it:

```bash
maker maker_opts.ctl
```

Genome annotation software like MAKER usually provide information about the 
exon-intron structure of the genes (e.g., in 
[GFF3 format](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)),
and sequence of corresponding messenger RNA and protein products (e.g., in
FASTA format).

> **_Question:_**  
> While MAKER is running, note the different file formats you have 
> encountered until now.  
> * Which type of data does each file format contain?
> * Do you understand the difference between the file formats and data
>   types?

Once MAKER is done the results will be hidden in subdirectories of 
`min10000.maker.output`. MAKER provides a helper script to collect this hidden
output in one place (again please ignore the warnings for these steps):

```bash
# Pull out information about exon-intron structure of the predicted genes. This
# will be saved to the file min10000.all.gff.
gff3_merge -d min10000.maker.output/min10000_master_datastore_index.log

# Pull out predicted messenger RNA and protein sequences. These will be saved
# to the files: min10000.all.maker.augustus.transcripts.fasta, and
# min10000.all.maker.augustus.proteins.fasta
fasta_merge -d min10000.maker.output/min10000_master_datastore_index.log
```

# 2. Quality control of individual genes

So now we have some gene predictions... *how can we know if they are any good?*
The easiest way to get a feel for this is to use the following example
sequences: [predicted protein sequences from rice and honeybee](predictions.fa).
We will compare them using BLAST to known sequences from other species against the Swissprot database (faster), or the Uniref50 database (slower).

## 2.1 Running BLAST with SequenceServer

We will use [SequenceServer](https://sequenceserver.com) to run BLAST. Open [genomicscourse.sequenceserver.com](https://genomicscourse.sequenceserver.com) in your browser, paste the [example rice and honeybee protein sequences](predictions.fa) 
in the textbox and click on the 'BLAST' button to run a BLAST search. *THIS WILL TAKE A MINUTE 
OR TWO*. 
<!-- Alternatively, you may use the results of the 
[BLAST that we performed before](https://genomicscourse.sequenceserver.com/42c77718-7b26-43eb-8315-d4ee9df96985).
 -->
> **_Question:_**  
> Look at the BLAST results:
> * Do any of the gene predictions have significant similarity to known 
>   sequences?
> * For a given gene prediction, do you think it is complete, or can you infer
>   from the BLAST alignments that something may be wrong?
> Start by comparing the length of your gene prediction to that of the BLAST
> hits.  
> * Is your gene prediction considerably longer or considerably shorter than 
>   BLAST hits? Why?

Now try a few of your gene predictions (**use the predicted protein 
sequences**). Run BLAST on only a maximum of 12 sequences at a time (instead of
simply selecting the first 12 genes in your file, copy-paste sequences randomly
from  the file). *This will take a bit longer*. 

As you can see, gene prediction software is imperfect. This is even the case
when using all available evidence. This is potentially costly for analyses that
rely on gene predictions, i.e. many of the analyses we might want to do:

> *“Incorrect annotations [ie. gene identifications] poison every experiment 
> that makes use of them. Worse still the poison spreads.”* – 
> [Yandell & Ence (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510764).

## 2.2 Using GeneValidator

The
[*GeneValidator*](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/10/1559.long)
tool can help to evaluate the quality of a gene prediction by comparing features
of a predicted gene to similar database sequences. This approach expects that
similar sequences should for example be of similar length. *Genevalidator* was
built to automate the comparison of sequence characteristics similarly to what we just did through visual individual BLAST results.

Try to run the [example rice and honeybee protein sequences](predictions.fa)
through *GeneValidator*. It should be accessible at [https://genevalidator.genomicscourse.com/](https://genevalidator.genomicscourse.com/) or [https://genevalidator.wurmlab.com/](https://genevalidator.wurmlab.com/). 


# 3. Comparing whole genesets and prioritizing genes for manual curation

*Genevalidator*'s visual output can be handy when looking at a few genes. But the 
tool also provides tab-delimited output, useful when working in the command-line
or running the software on whole proteomes. This can help the analysis:
  * in situations when you can choose between multiple gene sets.
  * to identify which gene predictions are likely correct, and which predictions
    need might require further inspection and potentially be manually fixed.

# 4. Manual curation

Because automated gene predictions are not perfect, manual inspection and fixing
is often required. The most commonly used software for this is
[*Apollo/WebApollo*](http://genomearchitect.org/).

We will not curate any gene models as part of this practical, but you can learn
about gene model curation through these YouTube videos:
